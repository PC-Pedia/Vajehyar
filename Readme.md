![](Usage.gif)



Using paper dictionaries for day-to-day looking up of words is like a nightmare. Vajehyar is an intuitive, minimal and efficient dictionary to find synonyms of Persian words in real time. **It's the first and largest Persian-language thesaurus dictionary.** All you need to do is downloading [last release](https://github.com/kokabi1365/Vajehyar/releases) of this app and find whatever you want among **183,000** words.

Vajehyar designed to be fast and lightweight and uses two popular dictionaries as its core database:

1. **A Comprehensive Dictionary of Persian Synonyms & Antonyms****, written by farajollah khodaparasti with more than 135000 thousand words;
2. [**The Thesaurus of Persian Words**](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF_%D8%B7%DB%8C%D9%81%DB%8C)**, written by Jamshyd Fararooy with around 45,000 words.


## Requirements

For windows 10 you don't need any prerequisites; but for older versions you should install [.net 4.6 or above](https://soft98.ir/software/209-Microsoft-NET-Framework.html).


## Installation & Usage

This application is portable and tries to remain so. The supplied installer is just for convenience and ease of things (copy the application to program files, making shortcuts and these sort of thing). For launching app just press **Alt+Shift+V** from anywhere in windows and press **Esc** to close window. You can change this shortcut from settings.


## Contributing

I welcome anyone to contribute to this project for fixing bugs or add new features, but I hope you be kind enough to avoid simply changing donation link and republish for yourself or worse than that sell it as a commercial app. That's not why I'm sharing the source code, at all.
