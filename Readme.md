![](Usage.gif)



Using paper dictionaries for day-to-day looking up words is like a nightmare. You need a fast way to find words. Vajehyar is an intuitive, minimal and efficient dictionary to find synonyms of Persian words in real time. All you need is downloading [last release](https://github.com/kokabi1365/Vajehyar/releases) and find whatever you want among **183,000** words.

Vajehyar designed to be fast and lightweight and uses two popular dictionaries as its core database:

1. **A Comprehensive Dictionary of Persian Synonyms & Antonyms****, written by farajollah khodaparasti with more than 135000 thousand words;
2. [**The Thesaurus of Persian Words**](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF_%D8%B7%DB%8C%D9%81%DB%8C)**, written by Jamshyd Fararooy with around 45,000 words.



## Requirements

For windows 10 you don't need any prerequisites; but for older versions you should install [.net 4.6 or above](https://soft98.ir/software/209-Microsoft-NET-Framework.html).



## Installation & Usage

This application is portable and tries to remain so. The installer is just for convenience and ease of things (Copy application to program files, making shortcuts and that sort of thing). As a default you can open the app by **Alt+Shift+V** anywhere in windows and It's possible to change this shortcut from settings.



## Contributing

I welcome anyone to contribute to this project for fixing bugs or add new features, but I hope you be kind enough to avoid simply changing donation link and republish for yourself or worse than that sell it as a commercial app. That's not why I'm sharing the source code, at all.
